# Text Editor
This is a basic text editor built from scratch for my CS61B course, titled "Data Structures".
The editor includes functions such as word-wrap, type/delete, window-resizing, cursor with clicking and key control, and a basic implementation of undo/redo.

The Editor is implemented in Java, with the two main files Render and Editor.

Assitance, reference code, and testing was given by the staff of this course.
